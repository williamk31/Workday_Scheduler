# Workday Scheduler

## Description
This application is designed to help the user schedule their workday. Each hour of the day allows the user to input an activity and then save the activity to local storage for later. The hour blocks will change color depending on the time of the day - the present hour will appear red, hours in the past are gray, and future hours are green. Additionally, the time of day is displayed in the header.

## Usage
To use this application, simply type in the activity you need to schedule for that particular hour block, and then hit the save button to the right. Activities you've saved from earlier will appear in their respective time blocks upon load.
